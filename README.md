<h1>🖧 Vulner</h1>
<h2>📝 Description</h2>
I created a Bash script for network scanning and vulnerability assessment. It prompts users for network details, output directory, and scan type (Basic or Full). Basic scans cover TCP/UDP, service versions, and weak passwords, while Full scans add Searchsploit for deeper analysis. The script checks for weak credentials in services like SSH and FTP, using custom user and password lists. In addition, it logs and displays results, enabling users to review and search findings.
